### Avatar

- [x] Add dynamic font-size change for the avatar component
- [ ] Add Avatar border color based on props like enabled, disabled, confirmed: I think this should be done in a new standarized way rather than adding it to the core component
- [x] Add tooltip to the Avatar, with the ability to hide tooltip if needed

### Avatar group

- [ ] Add avatar group feature
